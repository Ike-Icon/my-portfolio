                <p>
                  In 2021, I enrolled in BYU Pathway and decided to pursue a Bachelor of Applied Technology from Brigham
                  Young University
                  after a year. During this time, I focused on developing my knowledge and expertise in web and computer
                  programming. By
                  participating in BYU Pathway, I acquired valuable skills such as project and time management, as well
                  as effective
                  communication with team members and clients. These skills allowed me to efficiently achieve milestones
                  and meet
                  deadlines for various projects.

                <p class="Synopsis-highlight">
                  As a web developer and designer, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with numerous graphic
                  designers and
                  developers. Since my studies are entirely online-based, I usually spend most of my time interacting
                  with my peers from
                  school and other virtual platforms. This experience has allowed me to sharpen my ability to work
                  remotely and
                  effectively establish connections with people across different locations.

                  In my work, I believe that websites should be more than just visually appealing designs. They should
                  be intuitive,
                  user-friendly, and accessible to everyone. I am dedicated to understanding the unique needs and
                  objectives of my
                  clients, and I am committed to delivering exceptional outcomes each time. My portfolio showcases a
                  range of projects
                  where I have applied my expertise in web development and design. From creating responsive layouts to
                  implementing
                  interactive features and optimizing performance, I am passionate about delivering high-quality
                  solutions that align with
                  the latest industry standards.
